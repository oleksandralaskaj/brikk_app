# Case Study: Property Comparison

The case study consists of two parts:

1. **Static frontend HTML / CSS**
2. **JavaScript application**

## Static HTML/CSS frontend

The task is to replicate the following design, preparing both the HTML structure and CSS presentation:

### Requirements:

- Valid HTML5 code
- CSS written using the SCSS preprocessor
- Maximised usage of `em` and `rem` units instead of `px`
- Usage of the BEM naming methodology
- Properly indented code, emphasis on readability

## JavaScript application

The purpose of the application is to:

- Display information about two properties taken from a JSON object using the HTML structure that you prepared in the previous part.
- Compare price, floor areas, and land areas of the two properties and indicate which one has a better value with red and green background colours.
- Optionally, it can also allow selection of the two properties from a longer list of estates (the stripe at the top).
